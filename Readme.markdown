# Minimalistic Asynchronous Game Engine (mage)

Minimalistic (all-purpose) Asynchronous Game Engine.

Do not expect a fully featured game engine, this is just the basic that you must have to start working on your game from day-one.

Use [js-2dmath](https://github.com/llafuente/js-2dmath) as an abstraction for all math-related stuff.

It's in early stage wait a bit to use it or take a deep breath an start bugging me!

## TODO (0.1)

* Camera
* Input Manager
* Resource Manager (really needed ?)
